# Load the install_deb_package function (ensure the script path is correct)
. install_deb_package.sh

install_vscode() {
    # URL for the latest stable VS Code .deb package
    local vscode_url="https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=linux-deb-x64"
    
    # Use the generic function to install VS Code
    install_deb_package "$vscode_url"
}

# If the script is run directly (not sourced), "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" equals "${0}".
# This ensures that the `install_vscode` function is only called when the script is executed directly.
# If sourced, the function is loaded but not automatically executed.

# Script:
#     ask
#
# Description:
#     This script registers the `ask` function into the current shell session. The `ask` function is a simple way to ask for user input in bash scripts with optional default answers.
#
# Usage:
#     ask QUESTION [DEFAULT] [OPTIONS]
#
# Options:
#     Y       Set the default answer to "yes"
#     N       Set the default answer to "no"
#
# Examples:
#     # Ask a yes/no question with no default
#     if ask "Do you want to continue?"; then
#         echo "User answered yes."
#     else
#         echo "User answered no."
#     fi
#
#     # Ask a yes/no question with default "yes"
#     if ask "Do you want to continue?" Y; then
#         echo "User answered yes."
#     else
#         echo "User answered no."
#     fi
#
#     # Ask a yes/no question with default "no"
#     if ask "Do you want to continue?" N; then
#         echo "User answered yes."
#     else
#         echo "User answered no."
#     fi

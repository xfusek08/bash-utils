#!/bin/bash

# This is a Bash script that inlines a set of Bash script files into a single file. The script first
# defines the paths to the source and build folders, which are the folders where the script files are
# located and where the inlined file will be saved, respectively.
# Then, it creates the build directory if it doesn't exist and removes the build file if it already exists.
#
# The script initializes two arrays: stack and seen stack is used as a LIFO stack to keep track of the
# order in which the files should be inlined, and seen is used to prevent infinite recursion in case of
# circular dependencies between the files.
# The push function is used to push a file onto the stack.
# It first checks if the file has already been pushed onto the stack by searching the seen array.
# If the file has not been seen before, it pushes the file onto the stack and marks it as seen.
# If the file has dependencies, it pushes the dependencies onto the stack after the file itself.
#
# The script gets a list of all the files in the source directory and loops through the files, pushing
# them onto the stack using the push function.
# Then, it loops through the stack and inlines the files by reading each line of the file and appending
# it to the build file if it is not a commented line or a source or include line.
# Finally, the script prints a message for each file that is inlined.
#
# This script can be used to simplify the management of a large number of Bash script files by
# consolidating them into a single file.
